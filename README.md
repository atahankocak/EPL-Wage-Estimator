## General Info
I plan build a linear model to clarify EPL (English Premier League) managers' expectations from their players. 

The main idea is not to overpay them to maintain fair wage distribution and not to underpay them to avoid long-term performance issues. Also, the models output, what they actually deserve, is based on their attribute. A manager can use this to tune her/his expectations from the players.

## Data And Technologies
I used Beautiful Soup to scrape the data from the following urls:
- sofifa.com/players: to get attributes, foot, height, weight
- sofifa.com/teams: to get league of each team
- spotrac.com: to get the actual weekly wages in EPL.
